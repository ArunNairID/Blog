Summary: I'm taking the Andrew Ng Machine Learning course on Coursera and I found a way to apply simple logistic regression to my thesis work. I found two variables computed that describe something about a specific class of particle physics events I'm searching for, and I use logistic regression to determine (based on these variables) whether an event is one in which I'm interested, or is a background event I want to reject.
